		<p class="p21">What is a MOBA? As gamers, we happen to be pretty familiar with them, even if we’ve never actually played one. MOBA stands for ‘Multiplayer Online Battle Arena’. MOBAs make up a large chunk of the gaming population, originally spawning from real-time strategy games. Blizzard played a large role in the story of MOBA games and their popularity.
        With their iconic releases of StarCraft and WarCraft, (specifically WarCraft III), they set the stage for a more interactive experience and user-based content. Harnessing the creator’s toolkit via game editing programs, people modded these games to experience all on their own, only sharing color palettes and game sprites. All that said, what are the best MOBA games?</p>

		<p class="p22">League of Legends, aka LoL aka League, was developed by Riot Games for Windows and Mac in 2009. Defense of the Ancients, or DotA, directly inspired it. A feature I like from League is that every game takes place in its match, meaning that players all start on the same footing, leaving it up to the player to advance and get better skills and items.</p>
		
		<p class="p23"><br>League of Legends has a richly detailed backstory, with an original fantasy environment being written around the different champions, something I like over the other MOBAs. Destroying the opposing team’s nexus is the goal of the game, and you need to battle your way through a wide and wild array of character types: ranging from Eldritch horror to steampunk.</br></p>
