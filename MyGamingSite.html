		<p class="ptitle1"><em><b>The Philosophy</b></em></p>
		
		<p class="p1">Nguyen’s philosophy of games hinges on a key observation: the motivation behind gameplay is an inversion of how motivation for most other things operate. Generally, when we’re motivated to work toward a desired goal, the means are incidental and sometimes a nuisance. In contrast, in-game, the means — gameplay — is the whole point and the in-game goals are incidental. A completed playthrough of Darksouls II doesn’t improve your life. It’s the journey — the gameplay itself, which makes the game worthwhile. This observation allows Nguyen to open up a new way of thinking about the meaning, purpose, and value of games.
		Games are all about the struggle. Everyone prefers different kinds of games, with different levels of difficulty and forms of struggle. But whatever their preference, players play because they enjoy the struggle. We may value the struggle which comes with non-game goals, but games are unique in that we seek them out for the sake of the struggle. In-game goals are ultimately beside the point. It’s this phenomenon Nguyen focuses on when he argues a key element to the aesthetic experience of gameplay is striving.
		Unless we have to strive for an in-game goal, it doesn’t feel like much of a game. It doesn’t have to be exceptionally difficult but even Candy Crush requires you to strive, at least to some degree. Struggle alone doesn’t make for a good game experience, either. It’s the form a player’s struggle takes which gives a game its distinctive flavor of fun. A particularly good play in American Football or a head-shot in Halo 3 are satisfying game play experiences for both players and spectators alike because they’re good examples of how the game can be played. As a player executes a move in-game with particular elegance or barely manages to survive a boss battle, they have temporarily given themselves up to the game in such a way which dictates the form of their actions, motivations, and criteria for life-success.
		There is a structure to gameplay, and to it, our agency conforms. Here lies the beauty of Nguyen’s philosophy: games act as yoga for our agency. The artistic medium of a game doesn’t rely on particular materials or play techniques, since these all differ widely from game to game. The medium is the malleability of a player’s agency. To play, we must bend our will as agents into tight, orderly forms of struggle, failure, and success. We become new agents. We are the Dragonborn, an MTG master, a coldblooded hitman, a zombie slayer, a monopoly-hungry property owner, or the crusher of candies.
		Games enhance our strength and flexibility as agents. In the way yoga makes a yogi more flexible by conforming their body to rigid, prescribed shapes, games make players more flexible agents by conforming them to narrow, prescribed roles. Gameplay is an exercise in living.
		Agency in Times of Crisis
		We play games because we like them. Oftentimes, we play games as a form of escape. This is the usual, surface-level understanding of why we play games. Nguyen argues games act as an existential balm against the sting of real-life because they permit us to exercise agency within a predictable framework for success and failure. In times of crisis, this becomes especially important.
		It’s a fortunate coincidence this book came out in 2020, the year I needed it most. Like many, I’m surrounded by crisis and uncertainty. There is little to no sense of personal control over our lives. Many, including myself, have turned to games as a way to cope. This is potentially good and healthy.
		Gameplay has the potential to work wonders for our sense of personal control. Yoga is more than a mere stretch or a way to lose weight. It strengthens and brings its practitioners in tune with their bodies. Off the mat, a yogi is more physically capable by virtue of their practice. Games hold the same potential for our agency. Nguyen’s philosophy presents a powerful possibility. We have permission to delight in gameplay. Instead of treating it as mere escape or a guilty pleasure, we ought to embrace playtime. As a player, we bend, twist, and push our agency to new and interesting limits. When a yogi steps off the mat, they walk into the world with a stronger mind and body. When a gamer puts down their controls, they have the option to step out into the world with a stronger sense of personal agency — exactly the thing we need during times of crisis.
		Games help us live, even when living gets tough.</p>
		
		<p class="ptitle2"><em><b><br>The Dark Side of Gameplay</br></b></em></p>
		
		<p class="p1">Gameplay can be dangerous. We frequently attempt to gamify real life, at work, at home, and on social media. Nguyen argues this poses a potential moral and political danger. Gameplay in-game is potentially liberating and edifying. But outside the limits of a game, it can prove dangerous. Nguyen’s favorite example is social media. On platforms such as Twitter and Facebook, likes and shares act as a gamified social currency that determines what is and isn’t worth our attention. This distorts public discourse and the sharing of ideas necessary to upholding a healthy democracy.
		Another, more obvious example is the potential to overindulge in gameplay at the expense of living our life. It’s possible to play too much. Some have chosen to use gameplay as an alternative to life, rather than allowing it to enrich their life. Some are only happy when they play their favorite games and choose to let the rest of their life pass them by.
		Gameplay has powerful potential. With such power comes the possibility of misuse and abuse. However, as with anything with powerful potential, it is how we engage with gameplay that matters. There are better and worse ways to play a game that transcend in-game metrics for success. While games may feel like an escape from life, they’re an exercise in living.</p>
